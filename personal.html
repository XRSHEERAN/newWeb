			<h4>My Journey To SDE</h4>

				<li>
					<h6>Java</h6>
					<p>The very first language that I first learned in high school. Fun fact: I took a huge book that has over two thousand pages to the U.S. from China. Though I read nothing... </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>C</h6>
					<p>Learning C is a pain. I can still remember the despairment of mine when I encountered "Segmentation Fault". But still, C might be the closest thing I have to communicate with my pc. Still working on mastering.</p>
					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>C++</h6>
					<p>Still a pain in the a**. But I really like this language, it is neat and modern. I am trying to do machine learning project with it. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Python</h6>
					<p>Easy is the best.</p>
